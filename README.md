# Metamathematics
This is a meta - mathematics communication platform, which also indirectly safeguards the basic rights and interests of meta - mathematics researchers. When it comes to truth, discussing matters like "communication", "promotion", and "safeguarding researchers' rights and interests" might seem somewhat inappropriate. However, since it's challenging to conduct pure research in reality, we hope that via this platform, we can assist as many meta - mathematics researchers as possible in approaching the truth. Here's the current plan. The core activities here simply involve posing questions, solving problems, raising objections and offering explanations. Additionally, we'll conduct some promotion efforts through certain social media platforms. On weekdays, the focus will be on meta - mathematics itself. On weekends, the topics will revolve around things that meta - mathematics researchers can utilize to meet real - world demands after their studies, such as artificial intelligence logic, formal proofs, etc. Professionals in related fields are cordially invited to join, and others interested in meta - mathematics are also welcome.
